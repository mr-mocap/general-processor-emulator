# Instruction Specification
This document outlines the manner in which individual processor
instructions are specified.  This includes the opcodes, addressing modes,
byte count of any parameters, and what to display for the instruction.

## What are we going to specify
We will specify everything necessary to be able to decode an opcode and display
it as well as how long the instruction is (if necessary).
This will consist of , per instruction:
* The machine opcode
* Its assembly language mnemonic
* It's mode of operation
* What to display for the instruction
